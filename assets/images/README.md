Place your Christmas background image here as `christmas.jpg`.

Requirements:

- File path: `assets/images/christmas.jpg`
- Recommended size: at least 1920×1080 for full-screen background on web
- Prefer JPEG or high-quality PNG

After adding the image, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

If you want me to add a sample image for you, tell me and I can download a CC0 image and add it (requires internet access).
